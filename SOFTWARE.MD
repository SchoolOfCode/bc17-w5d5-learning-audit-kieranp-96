- My logic is poor this sticks to all modules so far.

## Database

- Setting up database and environment ✅

## Overall Improvements

- Think like a programmer
  - Plan better
  - Break things down smaller
  - Don't be afraid to google
  - Stop thinking negative 

- Javascript 
  - Think systematically 
  - Async/await



## How can I improve? 

- Be slower in my approach 
  - “If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.”
- Start building some projects and try collaborate on some real life projects.
